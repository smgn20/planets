Here's some nonsence I've recently written about pluto.
Do you think it's a planet? Have you considered how it feels about it's position in the galaxy?
I bet you hadn't.

This is science - feelings are a concept which can be appreciated but shall not dictate the quest for knowledge and therefore pluto's feelings is irrelevant as the needs of the many (planets!) outweigh the needs of the few.
